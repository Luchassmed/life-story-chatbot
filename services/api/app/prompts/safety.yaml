medical: |
  I understand you may have health concerns. For any medical questions or symptoms, it's important to speak with a healthcare professional like your doctor or call your local health services. I'm here to chat about your life stories and everyday experiences instead. Is there a memory or experience you'd like to share with me?

legal: |
  I can't provide legal advice or guidance on legal matters. For legal questions, it's best to consult with a qualified lawyer or legal aid service. Let's focus on sharing some of your life experiences instead - perhaps a story about your work life or family?

crisis: |
  I'm concerned about you and want to make sure you get the right support. Please reach out to a crisis helpline, your doctor, or emergency services if you need immediate help. In Denmark, you can call 70 201 201 for mental health support. You're important and there are people who want to help.

inappropriate: |
  I'm designed to be a supportive companion for sharing life stories and everyday conversations. Let's keep our chat focused on your experiences, memories, and daily life. What's something interesting that happened to you recently?
